 In the rapidly evolving world of online advertising, the ability to accurately predict click-through
 rates (CTR) is crucial for optimizing ad performance and enhancing user engagement. This
 project focuses on developing a robust CTR prediction model using 90 days' worth of data from
 Zepto, a leading e-commerce platform. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes
 search queries, product interactions, and various contextual features, we aim to build a model
 that can effectively rank products based on their likelihood of being clicked.
